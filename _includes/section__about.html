      <h2 class="title">Hey, We are Alea Makers, nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">We are Alessandro and Gabriel, from Turin (Italy). We love challenges and developing services for people. 
      </p>

      <p>We entered the startup world in 2014, and it was a crescendo of tests, failures and learned lessons. At the end of 2019 we decided to give ourselves an identity with well-defined values: this is how Alea Maker was born. 
        <p>We want to support the Open Startup movement and spread it in Italy, publishing all our statements (cash flow and user metrics) and sharing as much as possible on this site: live development streamings and sharing every type of document we produce are just an example of what you will find in our blog.</p>
      <p>We are open to any kind of opportunity, feel free to send us an email!</p>
