      <h2 class="title">Hey, We are Alea Makers, nice to meet you!</h2>
      <p class="subtitle subtitle--light">We are Alessandro and Gabriel, from Turin (Italy). We love to try and develop services that can help people. 
      </p>

      <p>We entered the startup world in 2014, and it was a crescendo of tests, failures and lessons learned. At the end of 2019 we decided to give ourselves an identity with well-defined values: this is how Alea Maker was born. 
        <p>We want to support the Open Startup movement and spread it in Italy, publishing all our metrics (cash flow and user metrics) and sharing as much as possible on this site: live streaming while we develop the services and every type of documentation we produce, explaining all on our blog.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™d love to learn about your company and see how I can help, feel free to send me an email!</p>
