Fudeo is a platform of online Italian courses specialized on the latest technologies for developers.

We started working on it in April 2019, choosing to debut with a course on Flutter, completely in Italian. We chose the Google framework (used to develop native Android and iOS apps with a single code), since we realized that, since Gabriel entered this competence on his LinkedIn profile, he began to receive various job offers. It seemed clear to us that there was a strong demand on the labor market and a lack of supply from the devs, particularly in Italy.

After choosing to take a course and the subject to be discussed, we asked ourselves what could be the best platform to distribute it. We evaluated all the most famous and it simply did not seem worth it: it is much better to spend some time and make a small investment to develop our own platform, rather than giving most of the revenue in fees.

We spent about a month planning and developing the platform. We used the YouTube player, which then allowed anyone who purchased the course to click on the title of the video embedded in our platform, open it on YouTube, copy and share the link with anyone.

It was good anyway, our goal was to test the market, to see if it made sense to invest money and time in the development of Fudeo. Before we started writing the code, we decided to sponsor a Facebook post to generate leads. The result was about twenty emails in a few days. It could have been enough.

So, here's the strategy: record the first three video lessons on the fifteen planned, create the platform and make them accessible for free in exchange for the email. Everything was ready by the end of May. We publish the platform and start the sponsorship on Facebook.

After about a week, a call arrives on Alessandro's personal phone: the number was taken from the Stripe checkout, indicated for assistance.

We had made the first sale and the buyer was worried because, beyond the first three, he saw no other lesson. At that exact moment, we realized that the "fake it until you make it" is dangerous for a product. We reimbursed the entire amount and gave him a 50% discount code that he could use when we arrived to publish the eighth lesson (just to be clear, we left him access to the course anyway). The next day, the situation repeats itself: purchase, refund, e-mail apology.

We decided, therefore, to record the other video-lessons and to signal throughout the site, even more times, that we were in the pre-launch phase and therefore the lessons had not yet been recorded all.

We updated the strategy: record and publish at least two video-lessons a week, communicating to all the contacts of the newsletter (which meanwhile was growing) some news, including a discount voucher. In practice, every week video-lessons were published and, therefore, the discount decreased (the first week by 50%, then by 35%, etc.).

Two weeks after its launch, Fudeo paid its own costs: it was self-sustainable. All the money collected has always been reinvested to improve the platform: one of the most important was the replacement of the video player (from YouTube to Vimeo Pro).

We are very attentive to the resolution of problems, it has been our characteristic since the first sale. We respond within 10 minutes to virtually all requests that come to us.

At the beginning of October 2019, we launched Fudeo 2.0, with completely redesigned graphics, new features and additional in-depth video lessons.

Consistent with the values of Alea Makers, we are working to launch Fudeo in the world of Open Startups: soon we will publish our metrics (cash flow and user metrics) that can be viewed in real time.
