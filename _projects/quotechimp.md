One day in mid-December 2019 we received an email with a quote request for a mobile app.

As usual we called the potential customer to deepen the project and define the requests,and then Gabriel took some days to come up with a quote for him. A few days later, on December 23, me and Gabriel met as usual at a coworking/costudying place to talk about Proance, and like each other time, we've started by organizing the tasks and deciding what to do first, in order to maximize our productivity for the day. Long story short, all of the tasks were about Proance, except for the quote, so we've decided to focus on the latter first. But unfortunately the potential customer didn't had a clear vision of all the features he wanted, so we had to understand on which options to focus first, and of course each one of them had a different development cost.

The problem was that we wanted to focus on Proance for that day, and writing a document for him to understand **which features to implement and so on was surely going to take a few hours**.

Therefore we've decided to **look for a tool that would allow us to create a quotation form**, with various options and prices. The first thing that came to our mind was using **Google Forms/Typeform** or something like that. But unfortunately, after several tools examined, **we weren't satisfied** with what we found. Thus **was born the idea** of creating a service that allows you to create quotation forms and **give the customer, in real time, a price estimate** of what was going to be the final price.

To understand if the idea could be useful to someone else as well we opened up an [Upcoming page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/quotechimp "Quotechimp's Upcoming page"){: target="_blank"} on ProductHunt, where slowly (it was the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve) we've started collecting some users.

Based on these data and on our necessity to deliver a good quote, we've decided to start developing, and in the worst case it would have been a learning-lesson and resolved our internal needs.

On january 10, 2020, **we released the first beta** on ProductHunt ([https://www.quotechimp.net](https://www.quotechimp.net "Quotechimp Homepage"){: target="_blank"}) and invited those who had shown interest on our Upcoming page.
