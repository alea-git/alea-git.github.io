Quotechimp is a platform to personalized forms for dynamic quotes and reservations.

One day in mid-December 2019, we receive a request for a quote for the development of an app on our Fudeo mailbox. As usual, we call the potential customer for a telephone interview, to deepen the project and define the requests well.

A few days pass, in which Gabriel elaborates the prices on the basis of what came out of the chat.

We arrive on December 23rd and, like other days of that month, we find ourselves physically working together on Proance: each time, before starting to work, we decide the tasks to be developed in the day, so as to be as productive as possible.

All concerned Proance, except the quote to be delivered. So, we decide to hurry up the latter immediately.

Unfortunately, the potential customer, not having very clear the details of how he preferred to structure his project, forced us to present more estimates, with different options and, therefore, with different prices.

Our goal was to develop Proance as much as possible and, most likely, we would have lost the day making the document.

We decide, therefore, to look for a tool that allows us to create a module with the various options of the estimate and with the relative prices, so as to have all the estimates in one. We find several tools, some to be implemented on your site (with old languages ​​or for Wordpress) others that approached what we needed, but without fully satisfying ourselves.

Thus was born the idea of ​​creating a service that allows you to create your own personalized modules for defining the definitive estimate, with the calculation of prices in real time.

To understand if the idea could also be useful to someone else besides us, we opened the upcoming page on ProductHunt, where, slowly (it was the days between Christmas and New Year), we started to collect some subscriptions.

However, we decide to start the development, since it would have been useful primarily for our internal use.

On January 10, 2020 we publish the first beta, inviting those who had shown interest on Product Hunt to register.
