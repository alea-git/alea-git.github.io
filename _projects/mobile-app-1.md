YouRemind was born during the last high school period, as a personal project of Alessandro (2015). The initial idea was the creation of a platform that would allow us to tell our everyday life in a digital diary, with the particularity of being able to choose one or more heiresses to leave, automatically, a copy of what is written in ebook format , when the platform was not accessed for a predetermined number of days. Therefore, the concepts on which the project was based were storytelling, legacy and privacy.

After completing high school, Gabriel decides to accept the collaboration proposal made by Alessandro, thus starting a period of development. In April 2017, YouRemind is accepted in Teatrabit, the support program for digital startups of the incubator of Politecnico di Torino: period in which we begin to approach and study the Lean Startup methodology. The result is a change of course: being economically too expensive to turn to consumers, it is decided to change course, directing the service towards the communities.

YouRemind becomes, therefore, a platform in which a group of people, like an association or a company, can come together to tell something they have in common, then automatically producing an ebook.

Towards the end of 2017, a collaboration begins with the Municipality of Moncalieri (province of Turin) and with Libera Piemonte, the most important anti-mafia association in Italy.

With the tests carried out, a long period of changes and implementations begins.

In October 2018, YouRemind is selected for the semi-finals of Idee Vincenti, a call promoted by Lottomatica and Polihub.

In January 2019 we publish apps for iOS and Android.

In April 2019 we decide to suspend the service: in the end, we realized that YouRemind was a fantastic gym, thanks to which we discovered and made our own a type of common mindset in the world of startups, based on experimentation, failure and learning.

Stopping for a moment to look back, we've probably done all the classic mistakes you can make when you're not experienced: for example, focusing only on developing new features, leaving out communication; dealing with a sector (mainly the world of associations) far from our interests (neither of us attends an association) and, most important of all, creating the solution first and then create a problem around it.

After all these years, being able to suspend YouRemind was, perhaps, the gesture of final maturity that predisposed us to move towards the creation of Alea Makers.
