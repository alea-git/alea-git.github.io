YouRemind was born during the last high school period, as a personal project of Alessandro (2015). The initial idea was the creation of a platform that would allow us to tell our everyday life in a digital diary, with the peculiarity of being able to **choose one or more heiresses and leave them automatically a copy of what is written**, through an ebook, when the platform is not being accessed for a predetermined number of days. Therefore, the concepts on which the project was based were **storytelling, legacy and privacy**.

After completing high school, Gabriel decided to accept the collaboration proposal made by Alessandro, thus starting a period of development. Later on, in April 2017, **YouRemind was accepted in Treatabit**, a support program for digital startups promoted **by the incubator of the Polytechnic of Turin**\: during this period **we began approaching and studying the Lean Startup methodology**. The result has been having **our first pivot**\: since we were economically too expensive for consumers, both in terms of time and money, we decided to pivot towards communities.

YouRemind became, therefore, a platform where groups of people, like associations or companies, could come together to tell something they have in common, and automatically have YouRemind make ebooks.

Towards the end of 2017, **a collaboration began** with the Municipality of Moncalieri (province of Turin) and with Libera Piemonte, **the most important anti-mafia association** in Italy.

With the validation carried out, a long period of changes and implementations began.

In October 2018, **YouRemind was selected for the semi-finals of Idee Vincenti**, a call promoted by Lottomatica and Polihub.

In January 2019 we published apps for iOS and Android.

In April 2019 **we decide to suspend the service**\: in the end, we realized that YouRemind has been an awesome gym, thanks to which we discovered and made our own the startup mindset, and all this solely **based on our experimentation, failure, learning and hard-working**.

Even though the project was born in 2015, we can say that we started to work on it consistently in 2017. In all these years, we have invested a lot of personal time and money (unfortunately I haven't kept the count) and **we have never collected even one euro**. We do have acquired some registered users, limited however to isolated events, with no return on the platform. Moreover, we have never used any type of communication channel, other than the classic Facebook page.

Stopping now for a moment and looking back, **we've probably done all the typical mistakes** most people approaching the startup world for the first time do: &nbsp;focusing only on developing new features, leaving out communication and validation; dealing with a sector (mainly populated by associations) far from our experiences (neither of us is part of an association) and, most important of all, **creating the solution first and then create the problem around it**.

> We are happy to have worked at YouRemind and, despite being a big failure, we want it to be part of Alea Makers' projects, because it is thanks to all these mistakes that we have grown: we exposed ourselves to failure, and opened ourselves to opportunities that we couldn't have grasped if we hadn't tried&nbsp;

(interacting with potential customers, learning to deal with issues not belonging to our studies, attending the course for development of early-stage entrepreneurial ideas organized by EIC of Politecnico di Torino and ICRIOS of Universit&agrave; Bocconi).

After all these years, **being able to suspend YouRemind** was, perhaps, the gesture of final maturity that predisposed us to move towards the **creation of Alea Makers**.
