Proance stems from the need to replace spreadsheets on Google Drive, where we keep the financial flows of our various projects. We want a tool that can be used in any circumstance, therefore mobile, and that simplifies the most common accounts: updating the cash at every sale, keeping track of the partitions of money among the "founders" of the project, create and manage budgets (eg for marketing, development, etc.), keeping an eye on the most important indicators.

Our target is digital entrepreneurs and makers in the first phase of their project, a period in which they begin to have accounts to manage but not enough to be able to purchase professional management.

For the MVP we are developing, we have decided to start by including revenue / expense management (already integrating Stripe) and a first version of analytics. With time, if the response from our target audience is positive, we will also implement the other features in the program: If you want to use Proance, go to the Proance site ([www.proance.app](www.proance.app){: target="_blank"}) and enter your email to be notified when we will be ready to launch the beta (we will decide if the beta will be open to all or closed, therefore only accessible to those who have entered their email)

It is the first project officially created under Alea Makers, and, for this reason, it inherits its principles and values: we want to share every step of the development of the app on our blog and make direct streaming during the actual development of the code. When we will ready to launch the first version, the cash flows and user metrics will be open.

Follow the development of the app in live streaming on our YouTube channel\!&nbsp;

We will update this page every time we make important progress.
