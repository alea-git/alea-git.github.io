Proance stems from the need to replace spreadsheets on Google Drive, where we keep the financial flows of our various projects. We want a tool that can be used in any circumstance, therefore mobile-friendly, and that simplifies the most common actions: updating cash at every sale, keeping track of how much money the founders put into the project, manage budgets (eg for marketing, development, etc.), analyzing how our data is behaving and keeping an eye on the most important indicators.

> Our targets are the digital entrepreneurs and makers in the first phase of their project, a period in which they begin to have some traction, and don't want to purchase and use a full professional management platform, because it's too expensive and too bloated for their needs.

Of course, like every Agile project that is borning, we've decided to start with an MVP, which is going to include revenue / expense management (with an opt-in Stripe integration) and some initial analytics. With time, if the response from our target audience will be positive, we'll also implement the other features in or roadmap: If you want to use or follow the development status of Proance, go to the Proance website ([www.proance.app](www.proance.app){: target="_blank"}) and enter your email to be notified when the app will be ready for beta launch (we'll decide later on if the beta will be open or closed to only the people who put their email in, don't know yet\!).

Proance is also the first project officially created under Alea Makers, and, for this reason, it inherits its principles and values: we want to share every step of the development on our blog and live stream it on our YouTube channel. But we don't want to share only the development phase, cash flows and user metrics will be open for everyone as well.

Follow the live development on our YouTube channel\!&nbsp;

Note: We will update this page every time we make important progress. Stay tuned\!
