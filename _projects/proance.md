Proance stems from the need to replace spreadsheets on Google Drive, where we keep the financial flows of our various projects. We want a tool that can be used in any circumstance, therefore mobile, and that simplifies the most common accounts: updating the cash at every sale, keeping track of the partitions of money among the "founders" of the project, keeping an eye on the most important indicators .

Our target is digital entrepreneurs and makers in the first phase of their project, a period in which they begin to have accounts to manage but not enough to be able to purchase professional management.

It is the first project officially created under Alea Makers, and, for this reason, it inherits its principles and values: we want to share every step of the development of the app on our blog and make direct streaming during the actual development of the code. When we will ready to launch the first version, the cash flows and user metrics will be open.

Let's start with the photos of the first blackboards: we started to think about how we imagined the project and, taking the necessary time, we investigated every aspect.
